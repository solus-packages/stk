        <Summary xml:lang="en">Audio signal processing and algorithmic synthesis classes written in C++</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="en">The Synthesis ToolKit in C++ (STK) is a set of open source audio signal processing and algorithmic synthesis classes written in the C++ programming language. STK was designed to facilitate rapid development of music synthesis and audio processing software, with an emphasis on cross-platform functionality, realtime control, ease of use, and educational example code. The Synthesis ToolKit is extremely portable (it&apos;s mostly platform-independent C and C++ code), and it&apos;s completely user-extensible (all source included, no unusual libraries, and no hidden drivers).
